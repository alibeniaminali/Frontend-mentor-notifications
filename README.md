## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Additional functionality and styling that I've added :
- The users can toggle the message to view it, when they click on the person who send it
- The message border has a little corner on the top to appear like a tooltip
- Most of the content is not hard coded inside the HMTL, instead I created a data.json file and dynamically added the content

## My process

The component renders with a disabled submit input. Once the user has selected a rating, the disabled attribute is removed and the user is able to submit their rating. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- JSON

### What I learned

1. Practiced DOM manipulation, styling with CSS and JavaScript
2. Practiced working with json files and conditional rendering

### Continued development

This is my third challenge with Frontend Mentor and first more advanced component. Next I will go for a similar project in terms of complexity to solidify some of the learnings I did during this project.
